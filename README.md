# TeamCompetition
The TeamCompetition application is a calculator that's needed for some swim competition events at SK70.
The application helps to calculate the final stage of a team competition where all teams have completed
4 diffrent events.

Every team is set to swim 4x50 backstroke, 4x50 breaststroke, 4x50 butterfly and 4x50 crawl.
The total time of this 4 events are added up and the placement in the final event 4x50 medley are calculated.

This type of team competition is not supported in the swim competition application SK70 is using today.
Hence the need for this calculator to do the jobb quick and easy.
